		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Join Steven and Brian as we dive into the world of Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality! Steven will play the role of the tour guide while doing his best to not spoil any of the surprises and Brian will play the seasoned adventurer who is new to this particular work.</p>
		<p>In this episode, we cover the first five chapters. They&#8217;re short and closely tied together. Harry is a scientific polymath and aspiring Rationalist and discovers he&#8217;s a wizard, goes shopping, and immediately sets out on the task of figuring out <em>just what the heck is going on</em> in the universe!</p>
		<hr />
		<p>Original chapters, written by Eliezer Yudkowsky, can be read <a href="https://www.hpmor.com/">here</a> and the audiobook chapters, recorded by Eneasz Brodski, can be found earlier in this podcast feed and on <a href="http://www.hpmorpodcast.com">the website</a>.</p>
		<hr />
		<p>In next week&#8217;s episode, we will be covering chapter 6.</p>]]></content:encoded>
